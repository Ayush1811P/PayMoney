## 1. Project Overview & Key Objectives

**PayMoney** is modeled after premier Indian fintech ecosystems (such as Paytm, PhonePe, and Google Pay). It provides an end-to-end simulated financial environment featuring peer-to-peer payments, utility recharges, bank linking, fixed deposits, dynamic QR codes, and multi-factor authentication.

### Key Objectives:
- **Instant Financial Transactions:** Facilitate real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers using phone numbers or `@paymoney` virtual payment addresses (VPAs).
- **Comprehensive Utility Services:** Support bill payments and recharges across Telecom (Prepaid/Postpaid), Electricity, DTH, and Broadband.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Enforce client-side SHA-256 hashing for sensitive PINs/passwords, email OTP verification, PostgreSQL advisory locks for atomic rate-limiting, and protected serverless profile creation via Supabase Service Role keys.
- **Lightweight, Zero-Bundle Frontend:** Pure semantic HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 with custom properties, and modern ES6+ JavaScript—ensuring near-instant load times with zero heavy framework overhead.

## 5. Core Features & Modules In-Depth

### 5.1 Landing & Marketing Suite
- **Interactive Navigation:** Smooth scroll navigation to Features, Download, and About Us sections.
- **Hero Presentation:** High-impact call-to-action converting visitors to registered users.
- **Feature Highlights:** Spotlights instant zero-fee transfers, bank-grade encryption, QR code interoperability, and intelligent bill reminders.
- **Mobile Responsive Drawer:** Clean hamburger drawer for seamless navigation on handheld devices.

### 5.2 Authentication & Two-Factor Verification
- **Dual-Factor Registration Flow:**
  1. Users provide Full Name, Email, 10-digit Phone, and Password.
  2. Client-side input validation ensures passwords are greater than 5 characters and matching.
  3. Interactive Terms & Conditions modal requires explicit user agreement.
  4. Phone and Email uniqueness are queried against Supabase `profiles`.
  5. Password is SHA-256 hashed before transmission.
  6. Email OTP is triggered using Supabase Auth.
  7. Upon OTP submission, the client calls `/.netlify/functions/complete-registration` with the verified session access token. The serverless function validates the token with Supabase and creates the profile using the **Supabase Service Role Key**, granting a **₹20,000 welcome starter balance** and generating a default UPI VPA (`<phone>@paymoney`).
- **Two-Factor Login Flow:**
  1. Primary authentication via Phone Number and SHA-256 hashed password.
  2. If credentials match, an 8-digit OTP is dispatched to the user's registered email address.
  3. A 100-second cooldown timer prevents OTP flooding.
  4. Once verified, a persistent session identifier (`paymoney_user_id`) is stored in `localStorage`.
- **Password Visibility Controls:** Built-in eye toggle SVG icons allow users to safely preview password inputs.

### 5.3 Wallet Management & Dashboard
- **Balance Privacy Toggle:** Users can mask their balance (`***`) or reveal it (`₹20,000.00`) by clicking an interactive eye icon.
- **Add Money Cooldown Engine:**
  - Users can top up their wallet balance using UPI, Debit/Credit Cards, or Net Banking.
  - **Rate-Limiting Protection:** A strict client/session **1-hour cooldown** (`getAddMoneyCooldown()`) is enforced per user ID. If a user attempts to add money within 60 minutes, the modal is locked and a countdown shows the exact minutes and seconds remaining.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Send Money:**
  - Users can enter a recipient mobile number or `@paymoney` UPI ID along with an optional memo/note.
  - The system dynamically looks up the recipient in Supabase, validates that users cannot transfer money to their own account, and verifies sufficient wallet balance.
  - Money movement is guarded by the **Global UPI PIN Verification System** before simultaneously debiting the sender and crediting the recipient.
- **Live Transaction Ledger:**
  - Fetches transactions where the user is either `sender_id` or `receiver_id`.
  - Automatically identifies whether a transaction is a **Debit** (Red) or **Credit** (Green).
  - Dynamically fetches and matches opposite-party profile details to render their name, transaction memo, and personalized avatar.

### 5.4 Unified Payments Interface (UPI) & Bank Accounts
- **Bank Account Integration:**
  - Allows linking checking/savings accounts from top Indian banks (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, PNB, Canara, etc.).
  - Auto-formats account numbers and validates standard 11-character alphanumeric IFSC codes.
  - Linked accounts are saved in the `bank_accounts` table and displayed with masked account numbers (`XXXX1234`).
- **Custom UPI Setup:**
  - Users select their preferred VPA (e.g., `ayush@paymoney`).
  - Sets a personal 4-digit numeric UPI PIN, hashed with SHA-256 and stored in the user profile.
- **Global UPI PIN Interceptor (`requireUpiVerification`):**
  - An application-wide modal interceptor. Whenever any balance deduction occurs (P2P transfer, bill payment, mobile recharge, or FD creation), this modal intercepts execution.
  - If no bank account is linked, it routes the user to link a bank account first.
  - If no UPI PIN is configured, it prompts PIN creation.
  - Prompts for the 4-digit PIN, verifies the SHA-256 hash against the database, and only executes the transaction callback upon verification.
- **Downloadable Payment Receipts:**
  - Every completed UPI transaction presents a success modal displaying the Transaction ID, Timestamp, Recipient VPA, and Amount.
  - Powered by `html2canvas`, users can download an official PNG receipt with a single click.

### 5.5 QR Code Ecosystem (Display & Dual-Engine Scanner)
- **Dynamic Personal QR Generator:**
  - Generates an official UPI URI: `upi://pay?pa=<vpa>&pn=<name>&cu=INR`.
  - Rendered in high-contrast crisp format using `QRious` on a dedicated HTML5 `<canvas>`.
  - Includes a one-click "Download QR Code" feature producing `<name>_paymoney_qr.png`.
- **High-Performance QR Code Scanner:**
  - **Live Hardware Camera:** Uses `Html5Qrcode` with an environment-facing camera, visual laser scanning animation, and real-time frame evaluation.
  - **Dual-Engine Gallery Image Scanner:**
    - If camera access is blocked or the user uploads a QR image from storage, PayMoney passes the image through **Engine 1 (`Html5Qrcode.scanFile`)**.
    - If Engine 1 fails due to noise or compression artifacts, the image automatically falls back to **Engine 2 (`jsQR`)**, which renders the image to an offscreen `<canvas>` and performs raw pixel array matrix decoding.
  - **Auto-Resolution & Redirect:**
    - Parses both native UPI standard strings (`pa=recipient@paymoney`) and plain text VPAs.
    - Queries the database to retrieve the receiver's real name and avatar.
    - Displays a verified confirmation card and pre-fills the payment modal in `upi.html`.

### 5.6 Fixed Deposit (FD) Investment Portal
- **Portfolio Summary:** Tracks total active deposits, aggregate principal invested, and total projected returns.
- **Pre-Configured Investment Tiers:**
  1. **Starter Plan:** 3 Months tenor @ **5.0% p.a.** (Minimum deposit: ₹500)
  2. **Growth Plan:** 6 Months tenor @ **5.5% p.a.** (Minimum deposit: ₹500)
  3. **Smart Plan:** 12 Months tenor @ **6.0% p.a.** (Minimum deposit: ₹500)
  4. **Wealth Plan:** 24 Months tenor @ **6.5% p.a.** (Minimum deposit: ₹500)
- **Interactive Returns Calculator:** Dynamically computes simple/compound interest yields, maturity dates, and total payouts based on user-entered principal amounts.
- **Deposit Lifecycle & Premature Liquidation:**
  - Active FDs display a visual maturity progress bar.
  - Users can inspect individual deposit certificates.
  - **Premature Cancellation:** Users can liquidate an active FD anytime. The full principal is refunded back to their wallet balance, and the portfolio is updated.

### 5.7 Utility & Bill Payments Engine
- **Mobile Recharge (`recharge.html`):**
  - Full support for Jio, Airtel, Vi, and BSNL.
  - Automated operator detection based on phone number prefixes (e.g., 98, 99 for Airtel; 70, 79, 63 for Jio; 94 for BSNL).
  - Categorized plan directory: **Popular**, **Data Add-ons**, **Talktime Top-ups**, and **Unlimited Annual** packs.
- **Electricity Bill Payment (`electricity.html`):**
  - Multi-state coverage across Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Gujarat.

```

---

### 6.3 Stored Procedures & Atomic Rate Limiting

#### `generate_and_save_otp`
Enforces a 60-second cooldown between requests and caps requests at 5 per rolling hour using PostgreSQL transaction advisory locks:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_and_save_otp(
    p_email TEXT, 
    p_operation TEXT, 
    p_hash TEXT, 
    p_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
)
RETURNS json
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_record record;
    v_now TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE := timezone('utc', now());
    v_time_diff INTERVAL;
    v_request_count INT;
BEGIN
    PERFORM pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(p_email || p_operation));

    SELECT * INTO v_record FROM otp_verifications 
    WHERE email = p_email AND operation_type = p_operation;

    IF FOUND THEN
        IF v_record.last_request_time IS NOT NULL THEN
            v_time_diff := v_now - v_record.last_request_time;
            
            IF v_time_diff < interval '60 seconds' THEN
                RETURN json_build_object('allowed', false, 'error', 'Please wait 60 seconds before requesting another OTP');
            END IF;

            IF v_time_diff > interval '1 hour' THEN
                v_request_count := 1;
            ELSE
                IF v_record.request_count >= 5 THEN
                    RETURN json_build_object('allowed', false, 'error', 'Too many requests. Please try again later.');
                END IF;
                v_request_count := v_record.request_count + 1;
            END IF;
        ELSE
            v_request_count := 1;
        END IF;

        UPDATE otp_verifications SET 
            otp_hash = p_hash,
            attempts = 0,
            last_request_time = v_now,
            request_count = v_request_count,
            expires_at = p_expires_at
        WHERE email = p_email AND operation_type = p_operation;
    ELSE
        v_request_count := 1;
        INSERT INTO otp_verifications (email, operation_type, otp_hash, attempts, last_request_time, request_count, expires_at)
        VALUES (p_email, p_operation, p_hash, 0, v_now, v_request_count, p_expires_at);
    END IF;

    RETURN json_build_object('allowed', true, 'request_count', v_request_count);
END;
$$;
```

#### `verify_otp_attempt`
Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting attempts to 3 before permanently destroying the OTP record:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_otp_attempt(
    p_email TEXT, 
    p_operation TEXT, 
    p_input_hash TEXT
)
RETURNS json
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_record record;
    v_new_attempts INT;
BEGIN
    PERFORM pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(p_email || p_operation));

    SELECT * INTO v_record FROM otp_verifications 
    WHERE email = p_email AND operation_type = p_operation;

    IF NOT FOUND THEN
        RETURN json_build_object('valid', false, 'error', 'Invalid or expired OTP');
    END IF;

    IF timezone('utc', now()) > v_record.expires_at THEN
        RETURN json_build_object('valid', false, 'error', 'OTP has expired');
    END IF;

    IF v_record.otp_hash <> p_input_hash THEN

## 7. Security Model & Hardening

1. **Defense-in-Depth Authentication:**
   - Client passwords and 4-digit UPI PINs are hashed using the Web Crypto API (`SHA-256`) before transmission and database storage.
   - 2FA email verification is required on login and registration.
2. **Elimination of Public Account Creation:**
   - Public inserts on the `profiles` table are disabled via RLS.
   - Account creation is exclusively performed by `complete-registration.js` running in Netlify serverless environment after verifying the caller's JWT token.
3. **Replay & Brute-Force Prevention:**
   - OTP records are immediately deleted upon successful verification.
   - Max 3 verification attempts before permanent OTP invalidation.
   - 60-second cooldown between OTP requests; max 5 requests per rolling hour.
4. **Transaction & Balance Safeguards:**
   - Add Money operations have a client/session 1-hour cooldown.
   - Peer transfers verify sufficient funds before debiting.
   - Transferring money to one's own account is blocked.
   - All balance-deducting actions require active UPI PIN confirmation.
5. **CORS & Origin Filtering:**
   - Netlify functions include preflight `OPTIONS` handling and origin checking against authorized domains (`https://paymoney18.netlify.app`, `localhost:8888`, `localhost:3000`).

## 8. Local Development & Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) (`npm install -g netlify-cli`)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### Local Environment Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Set the following variables in your Netlify dashboard or a local `.env` file (read by Netlify CLI):
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-id>.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-high-privilege-service-role-key>
   RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-api-key>
   ```

3. **Initialize Database Tables & Functions:**
   - Open your Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**.
   - Copy the contents of `supabase_schema.sql` and execute the script to create all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and stored procedures.

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```
   This will serve your static frontend and serverless functions at `http://localhost:8888`.

### Production Deployment to Netlify
1. Connect your repository to Netlify.
2. Set Build Command to empty (or `npm install`) and Publish Directory to `.`.
3. Add `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `RESEND_API_KEY` under **Site configuration > Environment variables**.
4. Deploy the site.
